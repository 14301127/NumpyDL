"""
Provides some minimal help with building loss expressions for training or
validating a neural network.

These functions build element- or item-wise loss expressions from network
predictions and targets.

Examples
--------
Assuming you have a simple neural network for 3-way classification:

>>> import npdl
>>> model = npdl.model.Model()
>>> model.add(npdl.layers.Dense(n_out=100, n_in=50))
>>> model.add(npdl.layers.Dense(n_out=3, 
>>>           activation=npdl.activation.Softmax()))
>>> model.compile(loss=npdl.objectives.SCCE(), 
>>>           optimizer=npdl.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.005))
