Development
===========

The NumpyDL project is started by `Chao-Ming Wang <https://oujago.github.io/about.html>`_
in February 2017. It is developed by a core team of five people:
`Chao-Ming Wang <https://oujago.github.io/about.html>`_, Jiao-Mei Liu, Shu-Ting Kang,
Xiao-Xuan Cui, Jin-Ze Li on Github: https://github.com/oujago/NumpyDL . The goal of
NumpyDL is making ``deep learning`` easy to learn and easy to use in native Numpy.

As an open-source project, we highly welcome contributions! Every bit helps and will
be credited!

1. Philosophy
=============

The development of NumpyDl is guided by a number of design goals:

* **Simplicity**: Be easy to use, easy to understand and easy to extend, to
  facilitate use in research. Interfaces should be kept small, with as few
  classes and methods as possible. Every added abstraction and feature
  should be carefully scrutinized, to determine whether the added complexity
  is justified.
* **Transparency**: Native to Numpy, directly process and return Python/Numpy
  data types. Do not rely on the functionality of Theano, Tensorflow or any
  such deep learning frameworks.
* **Modularity**: Allow all parts (layers, regularizers, optimizers, ...) to be
  used independently of NumpyDL. Make it easy to use components in isolation
  or in conjunction with other frameworks.
* **Focus**: “Do one thing and do it well”. Do not try to provide a library
  for everything to do with deep learning.
